AKA : Round 2 building a portfolio!

## Description
This is the rough start to my portfolio that I will be adding to throughout this course. I wanted to make one that was a little more personal - like adding my picture to the background. Once we complete more projects I will be adding them to the portfolio section. 

## Additional comments
I tried so hard to get "WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application." but I couldn't seem to get it right.

## User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
